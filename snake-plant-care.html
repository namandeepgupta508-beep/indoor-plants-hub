        <h1>Snake Plant Care: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide</h1>

        <p>Snake Plants (Sansevieria) are nearly impossible to kill, making them the perfect choice for new plant parents or anyone who wants lush greenery without the fuss. This guide covers everything you need to know.</p>

        <h2>Light Requirements</h2>
        <p>Snake plants are incredibly adaptable. They thrive in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bright, indirect light:</strong> Ideal for growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Low light:</strong> They will survive in a dark corner, but growth will be very slow.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct light:</strong> A few hours of direct sun is okay, but too much can scorch the leaves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Water Your Snake Plant</h2>
        <p><strong>This is the most important part of snake plant care.</strong> The #1 killer of snake plants is overwatering.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> Water only when the soil is <strong>completely dry</strong> all the way to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li><strong>In Winter:</strong> You may only need to water every 2 months or less.</li>
            <li><strong>Sign of Overwatering:</strong> Yellow, mushy leaves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Soil and Potting</h2>
        <p>Use a well-draining potting mix. A standard cactus or succulent mix is perfect. Ensure your pot has a drainage hole to prevent water from pooling at the roots.</p>
